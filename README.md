Shadowman is essentially a basic linear game where the player fights various forms of enemies and can take over each enemy and use their powers.

Currently it is a demo game with three different levels with 3 types of enemies and two boss fights. 

The barebones of the mechanics are implemented, such as fighting and taking over enemies and using their movesets.
